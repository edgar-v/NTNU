      <p>
      I have some experience with HTML already. I also have experience with
      Javascript and CSS for adding additional functionality. I also have a
      limited experience with web frameworks such as Angular and JQuery.
      </p>
      </p>
      I have experience with a lot of other programming languages as well, such
      as Python, C++, C and Java. and probably others as well.
      <p>
      <p>
      My expectations for this course is that we will learn HTML, JS and CSS.
      Not much more really. Also expecting that the course will have a lot of
      practical tasks so that we acutally learn how to make web pages.
