1. Mobile phones are often on a cellular network, and is usually charged for the data they use. Autoplaying videos could cost the user.
2. If they are using an older browser, the query will not be applied. If they are using a new browser and viewing it on a "screen" and not, for example printing it, it checks if the device screen is between 768 and 1024 pixels wide. Since the device is 320 in width, the query will not apply the style rules, meaning that they will (probably) see the #logo (assuming it is visible).
3. They share code bases, so you don't need to duplicate code or import common code from somewhere. Websites also usually try to sniff the UA string from browsers to figure out what device they are and redirect them accordingly. The number of UA strings are growing all the time and new rules will have to be added to your code. There is also the issue when a user on a mobile device is not catched and redirected to the mobile site they will have a bad experience using a webpage designed only for computer screens.
