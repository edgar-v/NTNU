      I have some experience with HTML already. I also have experience with
      Javascript and CSS for adding additional functionality. I also have a
      limited experience with web frameworks such as Angular and JQuery.
      </p>
      <p>
      I have experience with a lot of other programming languages as well, such
      as Python, C++, C and Java. and probably others as well.

      My expectations for this course is that we will learn HTML, JS and CSS.
      Not much more really. Also expecting that the course will have a lot of
      practical tasks so that we acutally learn how to make web pages.

          So that you can override specific parts without changing the
          CSS rule for every element of the same type. This is the cascading
          part of CSS coming into play. Note also that external stylesheets can
          override inline style by the use of <em>!important</em>

          ID could be used when you have 1 of something, like a cover image at
          the top of an article, whereas classes could be used for every image
          to give them some basic styling.
        </li>
        <li>
          RGBA: Red, green, blue, alpha. It as a color system where you can
          specify the amount of each component. With it you can express every
          color and with an alpha channel you can also express transparency.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <em>head</em> element containts metadata about the document and
          not actually any structure, therefore it makes sense that CSS is
          included there.
